            I'm a Full Stack Developer from Stony Brook, New York. 
            My interest in statistics and data analysis first introduced me to software engineering, but my love of problem solving drove me to pursue it as a career. 
            I'm passionate about designing and building software that enhances people's lives and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and improve my skills.
            I currently work at Epic Systems, where I get to do just that as a lead developer on the Data Warehousing team.

            I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May of 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
            Besides Notre Dame athletics I'm a die hard Yankee fan, and I love to hate the Giants when football season comes around.
            School also introduced me to Gaelic Athletics, and I'm currently a member of the Madison Hailstones Hurling Team.
            Outside of work I like going on runs around the lakes and playing golf on the weekends. I also enjoy reading and experimenting in the kitchen when I'm not outside.
