            I'm a Full Stack Developer from Stony Brook, New York. 
            I'm currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, while studying in Chicago.
            My interest in statistics and data analysis first introduced me to software engineering, but my love of problem solving drove me to pursue it as a career. 
            I'm passionate about designing and building software that enhances people's lives and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and improve my skills.
            I hope to leverage my studies going forward to find an impactful position at a company where I can continue towards that goal.

            I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May of 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
            At school I was introduced to Gaelic Sports and I joined the Notre Dame Boxing Club.
            Besides Notre Dame athletics I'm a die hard Yankee fan, and I love to complain about the Giants when football season comes around.
            Outside of work I like going on runs around the lakes and playing golf on the weekends. I also enjoy reading and experimenting in the kitchen when I'm not outside.
            <br><br>
            Following graduation I spent two years working at Epic Systems as a developer on the data warehousing team.
            Most of work went towards our in-house data ingestion tool, but I got opportunities to lead new development to support foreign-key functionality as well.
            My experience at Epic taught me a lot about adapting to product timelines and the demands of industry standards, and I hope to bring these skills to a new role in the near future.
